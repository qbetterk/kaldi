 This directory contains example scripts for speaker diarization on
 a portion of CALLHOME used in the 2000 NIST speaker recognition evaluation.
 The 2000 NIST SRE is required, and has an LDC catalog number LDC2001S97.


 The subdirectories "v1" and so on are different diarization recipes. The
 recipe in v1 demonstrates a standard approach using iVectors, PLDA scoring
 and agglomerative hierarchical clustering.
